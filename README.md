Santa Clause App - SINY After Hours Project (jQuery + JS)
====================

What you'll learn
---------------------
The best way to learn in my opinion is to do projects. Projects are what drive me to become a better developer. Not only will it teach you to problem solve and think on your feet but hopefully you'll be doing something that you thought up. Hopefully that will make you more invested in continuing the project till the very end.

What's Next?
---------------------
Before we start the after hours session it would be great if some of you clone the repo from github. All you have to do is head over to your terminal and navigate to your preferred location. Then type the following:

> ## git clone [repo ssh or https url]

You can grab the https or the url on the right hand side of this github repo. Once you have the repo (make sure you only get the master branch from the drop down of branches above). Don't worry too much about this we can set this up in person (although it would speed the process up).

What to do after this?
-----------------------
After this project there are a couple of options. You can continue this project. I designed it in a way that you can use the things I'll teach you on other sections of the app. That way you get to put what you learned to use right away. 

You can also contribute to some repos on github. There are plenty of open source projects that would love to have any developer with any amount of experience contribute to their project so long as they make meaningful changes. These changes can be as large or small as you want, functionality defeats quantity all the time.
